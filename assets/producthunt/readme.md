A truly private, offline-first, personal journal

## Description

JournalBook is a truly private, offline-first personal journal.

Your notes are **only** stored on your device, they're never even sent to a server. You don't even need to sign-in to use it! It works offline, so you can reflect upon your day on the slow train journey home.

Despite the lack of server, JournalBook is still fully featured, with tools like data import/export, autosave, theming and much more. It's super-quick, lightweight, and developed entirely in the open.

You can even add it to your homescreen as an app.
